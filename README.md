# track_player
This is an example app that uses SwiftUI, Combine, MVVM, and a UIKit coordinator.
At first glance, the app appears simple, but it is actually quite complex.
It features a floating player and multiple screens where you can play either a new track or a previously played track.
Additionally, you can observe the current player state and favorite state.
The task involved controlling and synchronizing the state from different parts of the app.
